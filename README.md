# Welcome to GitGoing!

This is the repository for everything associated with the GitGoing project, including the webpage, the backend structure, and a few tutorials provided by our developers to git you going!

This project if designed for introductory computer science students, but don't fear! These tutorials can be applicable to a wide variety of fields and skill levels, even with very little computer science knowledge. For example, the art on the site will eventually be user committed content as well. // TODO


## Our Goals

#### Tutorials
These helpful tutorials will be user submitted, interactive, and informational processes on the webpage. Each will have a specific goal to accomplish and skill to aquire / master for each user who completes it.

These will be sorted into "verified", checked by our developers and approved, and "unverified", those committed to the project but not yet reviewed. If a tutorial is deemed innappropriate or non-informative, it will be removed from our site and the submitting party will be notified. If we feel like it's a tutorial that is along the correct track, but not quite there, we will have a third category, "under development", where other users and our team can update and correct any errors in the tutorial in order to push it into the "verified" group.

For an example, please see the end of this file for your first tutorial!


#### Contributions
We would like to encourage an environment for users to see their contributions on the web immediately. In order to do this, we'll have a very vanilla user login system (email, username (optional), and password) that allows any users with a verified email to see their contribution become live on our site, a mere refresh after submitting it.

The basic structure of contributions is the picture that follows:

#### User Scoring System
While we hope people would come to this site out of their own curiosity and desire to learn, we figure there should be another draw to join us as well. There will be a system in place to count contributions, updates to tutorials under development, and tutorials completed.






## README tutorial

This is a README file (.md)


### Use of the # tag

You can use a # tag at the beginning of a line to make a heading, one # makes your heading
# BIG,
while adding multiple #'s will make your heading
### smaller
up to a total of 6 #'s, where it will me the
###### smallest

This gives you the opportunity to put emphasis and structure into your project description, and guides you if you're trying to understand somebody else's project.


### Why do README's exist?

This file should be first thing you write when you create a repository, and the first thing you read when you open somebody else's repo. It can be very basic to start, but you want to make sure it's a professional portal to your project once there's code to back it up. Think of this file as the resume to your code base, or the elevator pitch to your project. If you have multiple people contributing to the same repository, you can have each person contribute their section, but this file is intended to be brief.


### Final Thoughts

Understanding what README's actually look like and represent is often an aquired skill. The best way to gain this experience is to explore open source projects on GitHub and other platforms and read their descriptions. This may also open the doors to finding projects you'd like to contribute to in the future! Whatever way you prefer to practice this skill, enjoy doing it. If for nothing else, they don't get bugs!
