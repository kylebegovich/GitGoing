# Welcome to GitGoing!

This is the repository for everything associated with the GitGoing project, including the webpage, the backend structure, and a few tutorials provided by our developers to git you going!
This project if designed for introductory computer science students, but don't fear! These tutorials can be applicable to a wide variety of fields and skill levels, even with very little computer science knowledge. For example, the art on the site will eventually be user committed content as well. // TODO
