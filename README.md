# Welcome to GitGoing!

This is the repository for everything associated with the GitGoing project, including the webpage, the backend structure, and a few tutorials provided by our developers to git you going!

This project if designed for introductory computer science students, but don't fear! These tutorials can be applicable to a wide variety of fields and skill levels, even with very little computer science knowledge. For example, the art on the site will eventually be user committed content as well. // TODO


## Our Goals

#### Tutorials
These helpful tutorials will be user submitted, interactive, and informational processes on the webpage. Each will have a specific goal to accomplish and skill to aquire / master for each user who completes it.

These will be sorted into "verified", checked by our developers and approved, and "unverified", those committed to the project but not yet reviewed. If a tutorial is deemed innappropriate or non-informative, it will be removed from our site and the submitting party will be notified. If we feel like it's a tutorial that is along the correct track, but not quite there, we will have a third category, "under development", where other users and our team can update and correct any errors in the tutorial in order to push it into the "verified" group.

For an example, please see the end of this file for your first tutorial!


#### Contributions
We would like to encourage an environment for users to see their contributions on the web immediately. In order to do this, we'll have a very vanilla user login system (email, username (optional), and password) that allows any users with a verified email to see their contribution become live on our site, a mere refresh after submitting it.

The basic structure of contributions is the picture that follows:

#### User Scoring System
While we hope people would come to this site out of their own curiosity and desire to learn, we figure there should be another draw to join us as well. There will be a system in place to count contributions, updates to tutorials under development, and tutorials completed.
